        When establishing the base code you are basically entering in what you will build your webpage on. By setting a sort of template to fill in and add code to. This can be completed with the basic code in the image,both start and end lines of HTML establish overall page. The center and body/background tags are to set up a background for the webpage so that it won't be standard white. Both head tags are to place whatever is inside at the topp of the page, for example the navbar. The style tags are also placed in order to set up the style for the whole page like the text color and conctainers, which I will talk about later. In addition the body tags are placed in order to seperate the headers and style from the other content that will go into the page.

<h3>This is for implementing Javascript into HTML making a Calculator</h3>
<h2><font color="white">Step 1: Setting up HTML as calculator template</font></h2>
    <div class="container white-text">
        <img src="Screenshot 2016-12-14 at 11.19.23 AM.jpg" height="250" width="350" >
        <p style="width: 60%">
        When making the calculator there is 2 sides to it there is the Javascript which makes the calculator function and do what a calculator does and there is the HTML side which sets up the necessary HTML to build the physical features for the calculator. This was made by establishing that the page would be in HTML and that the language (lang) is in english, also establishing the body of the page where the calculator will be using the body tag. There are also center tags to add background if that is something you would like to do for the calculator page. 
        </p>
    </div>
<br>

<h2><font color="white">Step 2: Implementing CSS Navbar that connects this page to the rest of the pages</font></h2>
    <div class="container white-text">
        <img src="Screenshot 2016-12-14 at 11.17.40 AM.jpg" height="390" width="400" >
        <p style="width: 60%">
        Putting a navbar into the HTML of the calculator is necessary because it gives the user the ability to navigate through not just the to-do list and the how to page but also all the other pages that were created last time like the about me and hardware pages. It links all the pages together, therefore easier for the user to navigate through them. The first step in doing this is establishing the CSS styling that will organize the navbar, aswell as coloring it and making it obvious to the user. The next step is linking the already created navbar to the HTML page and making the HTML portion of the navbar. Since the navbar has already be created, you could either code it all or copy and paste it from a past page.
        </p>
    </div>
<br>
</br>
<h2><font color="white">Step 3: Creating the dropdown & inputs for calculator</font></h2>
    <div class="container white-text">
        <img src="Screenshot 2016-12-14 at 11.23.36 AM.jpg" height="250" width="350" >
        <p style="width: 60%">
        The inputs for the calculator will be on both sides of the select tags that will be made for the dropdown. The input tags will need seperate ids since they are self closing you will only need the begining tag. Preferably the tags will be serparated by 3 lines of empty code where in the middle there will be the dropdown, also the id the first input should be "num1" and the second should be "num2". When creating the dropdown for the calculator you need to determine what equations you will set up the calculator to perform, I decided on addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, to the power of, and the square root. All simple equations that symbols and names need to go in between an option tag. Before that you will need to set up the select tags with the id selector that will match the variable name that will be put into the javascript for the calculator. 
        </p>
    </div>
<br>
</br>
<h2><font color="white">Step 4: Defining the variables, starting Javascript</font></h2>
    <div class="container white-text">
        <img src="Screenshot 2016-12-14 at 11.29.06 AM.jpg" height="102" width="290" >
        <p style="width: 60%">
        This part is defining what the the variables are such as + and *. Those symbols are addition and multiplication we know what they mean but the computer only sees and undefined variable that it doesn't know what to do with. So the variable need to be defined in order for the calculator to do the equation and perform. You need to define each of the individual variables, which ever equations you choose to have as options for the calculator to do. For example the division symbol "/". This symbol needs to be defined as division the computer needs to know that when this symbol is selected in the selector that means that the numbers are being divided. That is defining your variables telling the computer what each symbol means and what should happen when it is selected. 
        </p>

<h2><font color="white">Step 5: Creating display and button, in HTML and Javascript</font></h2>
    <div class="container white-text">

        <p style="width: 60%">
        The diplay in this case what your user is going to see are the 2 text boxes to type in their numbers and the selector which will allow them to select which equations they want to do using the calculator. This is mainly showing how you would make the button that the user would see and click in order to perform the calculation and find the mumber they want. The part of the button that is in HTML is rairly simple it is mostly cosmpetic in adding the button where you want it to be. Then
