        Vindinium is where we test and fight out bots, it offers an outlet for the AI programs to fight and win. Since vindinium already has some set variables that help the AI move around and interact with the environment. Then setting the code in javascript it implimenting the tasks that go along with the variables and tasks that the AI bot needs to complete.

        This piece of code is what makes the bots decisions. Its what tells the bot to go to a tavern if its health is below a certian amount. It tells the bot what its tasks are what it needs to do and where to go. Making this it was important to consider what amount of minimum health to tell the bot when to go to the taverns. Setting it to less then 40 was an obvious choice since the bot would be very vulnerable and on the verge of death if its health was that low, it would then seek out the closest tavern to heal. I also put in that if the bot has more than 70 in health that is has the task of attacking the nearest bot and taking its mines. All of these are conditional tasks that affect each other.

        For the "freeMines" task it makes the bot go for the nearest free mine that is not yet owned by another bot. It tells the bot to collect as many of the mines as possible as long as it is close to it. The part that says findDistance finds the distance from the bot to the freeMine, so if there are multiple mines it will help the bot decide which one to go to based on its proximity.

        "enemyMines" is what tells the bot to go after another bot based on the amount of mines that bot has in its posetion. Similar to the freeMines portion of the code this part has something similar it uses the same findDistance as the freeMines except it uses it to find the position of the closest bot with the most mines. It then tasks it with going to the closest bot with mines, and taking their mines. After it has its mines it made it say "Got your Mines", it was appropriate to say and seamed like a good one liner.

        The "closestTavern" part of the code tells the bot to go for the closest tavern when it needs to be healed. In a previous portion of the code where it decides what tasks to perform based on conditions, if the bot's health is 40 or below then the bot's task becomes "closestTaverns" where this piece of code takes over. Using the same findDistance it finds the position of the closest tavern and goes to it. However this only becomes true when the bot has less than 40 health if it has more than that then the bot will not go to a tavern.

        <p style="width: 60%">
        When the "attackBot" part of the code takes over it is similar to going to taverns, the bot only performs the task if it has a certian amount of health and if there isn't any other task it needs to complete. If the bot has 70 or more in health then it has the task of attacking other bots and taking their mine's. It uses the same findDistance and closestBot.posArray to find the closest bot to attack, similar to the one that the rest of the tasks use to find freeMines and taverns.

        In the final part of the code the none task it exactly what you would expect it to be the bot roaming around until it finds a different task. The bot randomly picks a different direction to go in until it finds a different task. The "var rand" tells the bot to mathmatically pick a different random direction, the bot chooses from North, South, East, and West. It is important for the bot to keep moving even if it does not have a task it increases the chance of finding mines and tasks for the bot to complete. If the bot doesn't move then it won't find new tasks and it also increases the chances of the bot being spotted and attacked by another bot making this one of the most important pieces of the code.
