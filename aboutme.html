        Who are you?: 
        I am a senior at Summit Prep Charter High School. I have lived in San Carlos, California for my whole life born and raised. I am a hard worker I set high goals and when I put my mind to something I generally achieve it, I am really into cars old and new mainly american classics. I own a classic muscle car a 1972 Chevy Nova which I have rebuilt and restored as much as I can, I am very proud of it, it is one of my crowning achievements.

        What are your favorite things?:
        Two of my favorite things are my car and my computer. My car because it is something that I slaved away at for months blood sweat and tears and it feels incredible when you build something. Building anything especially a car that you know you will use for years to come, it's more fulfilling when you build something that will be used and have a purpose. I am proud of my computer because it has helped me over the years to get work done look for my car and all its parts. It is a my best tool and the most useful and versatile thing that I have at my disposal it's importance is unmatched, I will use it for years to come.

        Hobbies?: 
        I don't have many hobbies I try to be writer, writing screenplays for movies that is my hobby I have fun doing it and I like to think that the stories are good. I like doing it because it is very fulfilling and allows me to just use all of my imagination and at times either my daydreams or actual dreams, it lets me use all of my imagination. I got into it when I was in freshman year, my english teacher had us write a play within a group but I ended up doing all the work. By writing practically all of it I discovered that I really enjoyed it and had a knack for it, I really enjoyed it and I have been doing it as my hobby ever since.
