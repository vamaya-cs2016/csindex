<h3><font color ="white">Step 1: Describing Variables</font></h3>

        The first step in creating the Javascript for the car part shopping cart. All variables in a proper 
        javascript need to be defined in order for the code to work properly, and perform as it needs to perform. 
        The variables "part" and "carpart" both variables used to define and identify certian pieces of code that
        are in the HTML portion of the website. The "carpart" variable defines the selector that the user will use 
        to select the carpart that he/she wants to add to their order, the selector puts out the options the user can choose from. 
        Once the user chooses one the part that they want they simply click on "Add Part" and the part is added to 
        their shopping cart along with a discription of the power it puts out. The id tag "part" is the display where 
        the image of the engine shows up once the user clicks add part. The "Add Part" button is an event listener that
        only responds to the selector with the id tag "carpart". The "addpart" id refers to the button that is clicked 
        to notify the javascript to add the part that the user has chosen, it is used throughout the javascript. 
        The "totalprice" refers to the total amount that will be added up in parts in the shopping cart.
        All this was necessary because without the definitions of the variables the code wouldn't work, if there wasn't 
        any definitions then code wouldn't know what the variables mean and javascript wouldn't know what to do.

<h3><font color ="white">Step 2: Creating images using Javascript</font></h3>
    <div class="container white-text">
        <img src="Screenshot 2017-05-23 at 11.45.20 AM.jpg" height="270" width="360" >

        The code shown on the left demonstrates the javascript for the selector with the id "carpart", this code displays 
        the options from the dropdown selector. These two sections of javascript tell the system to add the image when the 
        user selects the car part and clicks add part. the "addpart = document.createElement("img");" tells the code that 
        there will be an image created and that it should be displayed in the "part" display. Then you need to attach the 
        source image which will appear on the screen, providing a source for the image will insure that it appears correctly, 
        you can also control the size of the image by limiting the Px and either making either the image appear larger or smaller.

<h3><font color ="white">Step 3: Removing images using Javascript</font></h3>

        Making the images disapear with a simple click is simpler than making the images appear since there is no 
        source material needed to make it function. By making a simple event listener that reacts to a click, and making 
        sure that the event listener only removes the "child" the image that has been created. Once it is specified in the
        code that it is the child image that is the only thing that needs to be removed, removing items from the shopping cart
        should be fairly simple and easy.
